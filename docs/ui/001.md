# Refactoring UI

## Starting from Scratch

- **Start with a feature, not a layout**
	- When most people think about *designing the app*, they're thinking about the *shell*
		- e.g. *Should it have a top nav, or a sidebar?* / *Should the page content be in a container, or should it be full-width?* / *Where should the logo go?* etc.
	- An *app* is actually a collection of *features*
	- First design a few features, then you'll have the information you need to make a decision about how the navigation should work

- **Details come later**
	- Don't get hung up making low-level decisions about things like typefaces, shadows, icons etc. in the earliest stages of design
	- That stuff will all matter eventually, but it doesn't matter right now
	- Don't introduce color right away - by designing in grayscale, you're forced to use spacing, contrast and size to do all of the heavy lifting
	- You'll end up with a clearer interface with a strong hierarchy that's easy to enhance with color later
	- Don't over-invest - sketches and wireframes are disposable - use them to explore your ideas, but leave them behind as soon as you've made a decision

- **Don't design too much**

	- Figuring out how every feature in a product should interact and how every edge case should look is really hard
	- Instead of designing everything up front, work in shorter cycles
	- Design a simple version of the next feature you want to build and once you're happy with the basic design, *make it real*
	- You'll probably run into some unexpected design problems along the way, but that's the point - it's a lot easier to fix them in an interface you can actually use than it is to imagine every edge case in advance
	- Iterate on the working design until there are no more problems left to solve, then jump back into design mode and start working on the next feature
	- Don't get overwhelmed working in the abstract - build the real thing as early as possible
	- Be a pessimist - don't imply functionallity in your design that you aren't ready to build
	- When designing a new feature, **expect it to be hard to build** - design the smallest useful version, if part of a feature is *nice to have*, **design it later** - built the simple version first and you'll always have something to fall back on

- **Choose a personality**
