# Game theory 101

- Game theory is a method of studying strategic situations
- Strategic situation - it's a setting where the outcomes that affect you depend not just on your own actions, but on actions of others
- Application: Economics, Political science, Law, Biology, Sport...

**The Grade Game**

```
Without showing your neighbor what you are doing, write down on a form either the letter α or the letter β. Think of this as a 'grade bid'. We will randomly pair your form with one other form. Neither you nor your pair will ever know with whom you were paired. Here is how grades may be assigned for this course:

- If you put α and your pair puts β, then you will get grade "A", and your pair grade "D"
- If both you and your pair put α, then you both will get grade "C"
- If you put β and your pair puts α, then you will get grade "D", and your pair grade "A"
- If both you and your pair put β, then you will both get grade "B"
```

- The possible choices [α, β] are called *strategies*
- The grades ["A", "B", "C", "D"] are *outcomes*
- Outcome matrix:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair β</strong>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>C / C</td>
			<td>A / D</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me β</strong>
			</td>
			<td>D / A</td>
			<td>B / B</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- What strategy should a rational person choose?
- To answer this, we first need to know what payoff does each outcome yield for this person
- This depends on the preferences (and moral sentiments?) of the players
- Game theory can not tell us what payoffs to assign to outcomes, but can help us once payoffs are known

**Possible payoffs: Evil person vs Evil person**

- Let us assume that every player is an *evil person* - each only cares about his own grade
- Payoff matrix:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair β</strong>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>0, 0</td>
			<td>3, -1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me β</strong>
			</td>
			<td>-1, 3</td>
			<td>1, 1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- If my pair chooses α:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`0`) then me choosing β (`-1`)
- If my pair chooses β:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`3`) then me choosing β (`1`)
- Strategy α is dominant strategy

**Definition:** My strategy α strictly dominates my strategy β if my payoff from α is strictly higher than that from β regardless of other's choices.

**Lesson:** You should never play a strictly dominated strategy.

Unfortunately, the reasoning is the same for my pair: given these payoffs, he will also choose α. We will end up both getting "C" even though there is a possible outcome ("B", "B") that is better for both of us. To use some economics jargon: the outcome ("C", "C") is *Pareto inefficient*.

**Lesson:** Rational play by rational players can lead to bad outcomes.

**Possible payoffs: Good person vs Good person**

- Let us assume that every player is a *good person* - cares not only about his own grade but also about the grade of the person with whom he is paired
- Payoff matrix:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair β</strong>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>0, 0</td>
			<td>-1, -3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me β</strong>
			</td>
			<td>-3, -1</td>
			<td>1, 1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- If my pair chooses α:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`0`) then me choosing β (`-3`)
- If my pair chooses β:
	- Me choosing β yields a higher payoff (`1`) then me choosing α (`-1`)
- No strategy is dominant
- The best choice depends on what I think my pair is likely to do
- Games like this are called co-ordination games

**Lesson:** To figure out what actions you should choose in a game, a good first step is to figure out what are your payoffs (what do you care about) and what are other player's payoffs.

**Possible payoffs: Evil person vs Good person**

- Payoff matrix:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair β</strong>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>0, 0</td>
			<td>3, -3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me β</strong>
			</td>
			<td>-1, -1</td>
			<td>1, 1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- If my pair chooses α:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`0`) then me choosing β (`-1`)
- If my pair chooses β:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`3`) then me choosing β (`1`)
- My strategy α strictly dominates my strategy β
- Therefore I should choose α

**Possible payoffs: Good person vs Evil person**

- Payoff matrix:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>
				<strong>Pair β</strong>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me α</strong>
			</td>
			<td>0, 0</td>
			<td>-1, -1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>Me β</strong>
			</td>
			<td>-3, 3</td>
			<td>1, 1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- If my pair chooses α:
	- Me choosing α yields a higher payoff (`0`) then me choosing β (`-3`)
- If my pair chooses β:
	- Me choosing β yields a higher payoff (`1`) then me choosing α (`-1`)
- Neither of my strategies dominates the other
- But my pair's strategy α strictly dominates his strategy β
- Therefore if I know he is rational then I know he'll play α
- In that case, I should play α (to get `0` > `-3`)

**Lesson:** If you do not have a dominated strategy, put yourself in your opponent's shoes to try to predict what they will do. For example, in their shoes, you would not choose a dominated strategy.
