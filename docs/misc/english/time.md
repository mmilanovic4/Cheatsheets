	- `06:25` - It's six twenty-five
	- `08:05` - It's eight o-five
2. Minutes + **PAST**/**TO** + hour
	- `14:10` - It's ten **past** two
	- `14:40` - It's twenty **to** three

**What time is it?**

- `14:05` - It's five **past** two
- `14:15` - It's quarter **past** two
- `14:30` - It's half **past** two / It's two thirty
- `14:35` - It's twenty-five **to** three
- `14:45` - It's quarter **to** three

**12:00**

**AM vs PM**

**Giving the time**

- it is/it's - *time right now*
	- e.g. What time is it? **It's half past five** (05:30).
- **AT** + time - *time of a specific event*
	- e.g. When does the bus arrive from London? The bus arrives **at midday** (12:00).
