# Modules

**Modules**

- A module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use (its *interface)*
- Module interfaces have a lot in common with object interfaces - they make part of the module available to the outside world and keep the rest private
- The relations between modules are called *dependencies*
- When a module needs a piece from another module, it is said to depend on that module

**Packages**

- One of the advantages of building a program out of separate pieces, and being actually able to run those pieces on their own, is that you might be able to apply the same piece in different programs
- A package is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed)
- It may contain one or more modules and has information about which other packages it depends on
- A package also usually comes with documentation explaining what it does so that people who didn't write it might still be able to use it
- When a problem is found in a package or a new feature is added, the package is updated, now the programs that depend on it (which may also be packages) can upgrade to the new version
- Working in this way requires infrastructure - we need a place to store and find packages and a convenient way to install and upgrade them
- In the JS world, this infrastructure is provided by NPM
- NPM:
	- An online service where one can download (and upload) packages
	- A program (bundled with Node.js) that helps you install and manage them
- By default, you own the copyright to the code you write, and other people may use it only with your permission
- But because some people are just nice and because publishing good software can help make you a little bit famous among programmers, many packages are published under a license that explicitly allows other people to use it
- Most code on NPM is licensed this way, but when using other people's packages, make sure you are aware of their license

**Improvised modules**

- Until 2015, the JS language had no built-in module system
- Yet people had been building large systems in JS for more than a decade, and they needed modules
- So they designed their own module systems on top of the language
- You can use JS functions to create local scopes and objects to represent module interfaces

```
const weekDay = function() {
	const names = [
		"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"
	];
	return {
		name(number) { return names[number]; },
		number(name) { return names.indexOf(name); }
	};
}();

console.log(weekDay.name(0)); // Monday
console.log(weekDay.number("Tuesday")); // 1
```

- This is a module for going between day names and numbers
- Its interface consists of `weekDay.name` and `weekDay.number`, and it hides its local binding names inside the scope of a function expression that is immediately invoked
- This style of modules provides isolation, to a certain degree, but it does not declare dependencies
- Instead, it just puts its interface into the global scope and expects its dependencies, if any, to do the same
- If we want to make dependency relations part of the code, we'll have to take control of loading dependencies
- Doing that requires being able to execute strings as code and JS can do this

**Evaluating data as code**

- There are several ways to take data (a string of code) and run it as part of the current program
- The most obvious way is the special operator `eval`, which will execute a string in the *current* scope
- This is usually a bad idea because it breaks some of the properties that scopes normally have, such as it being easily predictable which binding a given name refers to:

```
const x = 1;
function evalAndReturnX(code) {
	eval(code);
	return x;
}

console.log(evalAndReturnX("var x = 2")); // 2
console.log(x); // 1
```

- A less scary way of interpreting data as code is to use the `Function` constructor
- It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names and a string containing the function body
- It wraps the code in a function value so that it gets its own scope and won't do odd things with other scopes

```
let plusOne = Function("n", "return n + 1");
console.log(plusOne(4)); // 5
```

- This is precisely what we need for a module system - we can wrap the module's code in a function and use that function's scope as module scope

**CommonJS**

- The most widely used approach to bolted-on JS modules is called *CommonJS modules*
- Node.js uses it and is the system used by most packages on NPM
- The main concept in CommonJS modules is a function called `require`
- When you call this with the module name of a dependency, it makes sure the module is loaded and returns its interface
- Because the loader wraps the module code in a function, modules automatically get their own local scope
- All they have to do is call `require` to access their dependencies and put their interface in the object bound to `exports`

```
const ordinal = require("ordinal");
const { days, months } = require("date-names");

exports.formatDate = function(date, format) {
	return format.replace(/YYYY|M(MMM)?|Do?|dddd/g, tag => {
		if (tag == "YYYY") return date.getFullYear();
		if (tag == "M") return date.getMonth();
		if (tag == "MMMM") return months[date.getMonth()];
		if (tag == "D") return date.getDate();
		if (tag == "Do") return ordinal(date.getDate());
		if (tag == "dddd") return days[date.getDay()];
		return "";
	});
};
```

- This example module provides a date-formatting function
- It uses two packages from NPM:
	- `ordinal` to convert numbers to strings like `"1st"` and `"2nd"`
	- `date-names` to get the English names for weekdays and months
- The interface of `ordinal` is a single function, whereas `date-names` exports an object containing multiple things-days and months are arrays of names (destructuring is very convenient when creating bindings for imported interfaces)
- It exports a single function, `formatDate`, which takes a `Date` object and a template string
- The module adds its interface function to `exports` so that modules that depend on it get access to it
- We could use the module like this:

```
const { formatDate } = require("./format-date");

console.log(formatDate(new Date(2018, 6, 13), "dddd the Do"));
// Friday the 13th
```

- To avoid loading the same module multiple times, `require` keeps a store (cache) of already loaded modules
- When called, it first checks if the requested module has been loaded and, if not, loads it
- This involves reading the module's code, wrapping it in a function and calling it
- The interface of the `ordinal` package we saw before is not an object but a function - a quirk of the CommonJS modules is that, though the module system will create an empty interface object for you (bound to `exports`), you can replace that with any value by overwriting `module.exports` - this is done by many modules to export a single value instead of an interface object
- The way the string given to `require` is translated to an actual filename or web address differs in different systems
- When it starts with `"./"` or `"../"`, it is generally interpreted as relative to the current module's filename
- So `"./format-date"` would be the file named `format-date.js` in the same directory
- When the name isn't relative, Node.js will look for an installed package by that name
- In the example code in this chapter, we'll interpret such names as referring to NPM packages - we'll go into more detail on how to install and use NPM modules

**ECMAScript modules**

- CommonJS modules work quite well and, in combination with NPM, have allowed the JS community to start sharing code on a large scale, but they remain a bit of a duct-tape hack
- The things you add to `exports` are not available in the local scope, for example
- And because `require` is a normal function call taking any kind of argument, not just a string literal, it can be hard to determine the dependencies of a module without running its code
- This is why the JS standard from 2015 introduces its own, different module system
- It is usually called *ES modules*, where *ES* stands for ECMAScript
- The main concepts of dependencies and interfaces remain the same, but the details differ
- For one thing, the notation is now integrated into the language
- Instead of calling a function to access a dependency, you use a special `import` keyword
- Similarly, the `export` keyword is used to export things - it may appear in front of a function, class or binding definition

```
import ordinal from "ordinal";
import { months, days } from "date-names";

export function formatDate(date, format) {/* ... */};
```

- An ES module's interface is not a single value but a set of named bindings
- The preceding module binds `formatDate` to a function
- When you import from another module, you import the binding, not the value, which means an exporting module may change the value of the binding at any time, and the modules that import it will see its new value
- When there is a binding named `default`, it is treated as the module's main exported value
- If you import a module like `ordinal` in the example, without braces around the binding name, you get its `default` binding
- Such modules can still export other bindings under different names alongside their `default` export

```
export default ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"];
```

- It is possible to rename imported bindings using the word `as`:

```
import { days as dayNames } from "date-names";

console.log(dayNames.length); // 7
```

- Another important difference is that ES module imports happen before a module's script starts running
- That means `import` declarations may not appear inside functions or blocks, and the names of dependencies must be quoted strings, not arbitrary expressions
- Many projects are written using ES modules and then automatically converted to some other format when published
- We are in a transitional period in which two different module systems are used side by side, and it is useful to be able to read and write code in either of them

**Building and bundling**

- In fact, many JS projects aren't even, technically, written in JS
- There are extensions, such as the type checking dialect (TypeScript), that are widely used
- To make this possible, they *compile* their code, translating it from their chosen JS dialect to plain old JS - or even to a past version of JS - so that old browsers can run it
- Including a modular program that consists of 200 different files in a web page produces its own problems
- If fetching a single file over the network takes 50 milliseconds, loading the whole program takes 10 seconds or maybe half that if you can load several files simultaneously
- Because fetching a single big file tends to be faster than fetching a lot of tiny ones, web programmers have started using tools that roll their programs (which they painstakingly split into modules) back into a single big file before they publish it to the Web - such tools are called *bundlers*
- Apart from the number of files, the *size* of the files also determines how fast they can be transferred over the network
- Thus, the JS community has invented *minifiers*
- These are tools that take a JS program and make it smaller by automatically removing comments and whitespace, renaming bindings, and replacing pieces of code with equivalent code that take up less space
- So it is not uncommon for the code that you find in an NPM package or that runs on a web page to have gone through *multiple* stages of transformation - converted from modern JS to historic JS, from ES module format to CommonJS, bundled, and minified
- We won't go into the details of these tools here since they tend to be boring and change rapidly - just be aware that the JS code you run is often not the code as it was written
