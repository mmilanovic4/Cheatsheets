# Regular expressions

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.

**Regular expressions**

- Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data
- They form a small, separate language that is part of JS and many other languages and systems

**Creating a regular expression**

- A regular expression is a type of object
- It can be either constructed with the `RegExp` constructor or written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in forward slash (`/`) characters

```
let re1 = new RegExp("abc");
let re2 = /abc/;
```

- Both of those regular expression objects represent the same pattern: an *a* character followed by a *b* followed by a *c*
- When using the `RegExp` constructor, the pattern is written as a normal string, so the usual rules apply for backslashes
- The second notation, where the pattern appears between slash characters, treats backslashes somewhat differently
- First, since a forward slash ends the pattern, we need to put a backslash before any forward slash that we want to be *part* of the pattern
- In addition, backslashes that aren't part of special character codes (like `\n`) will be *preserved*, rather than ignored as they are in strings, and change the meaning of the pattern
- Some characters, such as question marks and plus signs, have special meanings in regular expressions and must be preceded by a backslash if they are meant to represent the character itself

```
let eighteenPlus = /eighteen\+/;
```

**Testing for matches**

- Regular expression objects have a number of methods
- The simplest one is `test`
- If you pass it a string, it will return a boolean telling you whether the string contains a match of the pattern in the expression

```
console.log(/abc/.test("abcde")); // true
console.log(/abc/.test("abxde")); // false
```

- A regular expression consisting of only nonspecial characters simply represents that sequence of characters
- If *abc* occurs anywhere in the string we are testing against (not just at the start), `test` will return `true`

**Sets of characters**

- Finding out whether a string contains *abc* could just as well be done with a call to `indexOf`, regular expressions allow us to express more complicated patterns
- In a regular expression, putting a set of characters between square brackets makes that part of the expression match any of the characters between the brackets
- Both of the following expressions match all strings that contain a digit:

```
console.log(/[0123456789]/.test("in 1992"));
console.log(/[0-9]/.test("in 1992"));
```

- Within square brackets, a hyphen (`-`) between two characters can be used to indicate a range of characters, where the ordering is determined by the character's Unicode number
- A number of common character groups have their own built-in shortcuts:
	- `\d` Any digit character
	- `\w` An alphanumeric character (“word character”)
	- `\s` Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)
	- `\D` A character that is not a digit
	- `\W` A nonalphanumeric character
	- `\S` A nonwhitespace character
	- `.` Any character except for newline
- These backslash codes can also be used inside square brackets
- But the period and other special characters, between square brackets, lose their special meaning
- To *invert* a set of characters - that is, to express that you want to match any character except the ones in the set - you can write a caret (`^`) character after the opening bracket

```
let notBinary = /[^01]/;
console.log(notBinary.test("0010101111")); // false
console.log(notBinary.test("0210101111")); // true
```

**Repeating parts of a pattern**

- We now know how to match a single digit, but what if we want to match a whole number - a sequence of one or more digits?
- When you put a plus sign (`+`) after something in a regular expression, it indicates that the element may be repeated more than once
- The star (`*`) has a similar meaning but also allows the pattern to match zero times

```
console.log(/'\d+'/.test("'123'")); // true
console.log(/'\d+'/.test("''")); // false
console.log(/'\d*'/.test("'123'")); // true
console.log(/'\d*'/.test("''")); // true
```

- A question mark makes a part of a pattern *optional*, meaning it may occur zero times or one time

```
let neighbor = /neighbou?r/;
console.log(neighbor.test("neighbour")); // true
console.log(neighbor.test("neighbor")); // true
```

- To indicate that a pattern should occur a precise number of times, use braces
- Putting `{4}` after an element, for example, requires it to occur exactly four times
- It is also possible to specify a range this way: `{2,4}` means the element must occur at least twice and at most four times
- You can also specify open-ended ranges when using braces by omitting the number after the comma, so, `{5,}` means five or more times

**Grouping subexpressions**

- To use an operator like `*` or `+` on more than one element at a time, you have to use parentheses
- A part of a regular expression that is enclosed in parentheses counts as a single element as far as the operators following it are concerned

```
let cartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/i;
console.log(cartoonCrying.test("Boohoooohoooo")); // true
```

- The first and second `+` characters apply only to the second *o* in *boo* and *hoo*, respectively
- The third `+` applies to the whole group (`hoo+`), matching one or more sequences like that
- The `i` at the end of the expression in the example makes this regular expression case insensitive

**Matches and groups**

- The `test` method is the absolute simplest way to match a regular expression - it tells you only whether it matched and nothing else
- Regular expressions also have an `exec` (execute) method that will return `null` if no match was found and return an object with information about the match otherwise

```
let match = /\d+/.exec("one two 100");
console.log(match); // ["100"]
console.log(match.index); // 8
```

- An object returned from `exec` has an `index` property that tells us *where* in the string the successful match begins
- Other than that, the object looks like (and in fact is) an array of strings, whose first element is the string that was matched
- String values have a `match` method that behaves similarly

```
console.log("one two 100".match(/\d+/)); // ["100"]
```

- When the regular expression contains subexpressions grouped with parentheses, the text that matched those groups will also show up in the array
- The whole match is always the first element, the next element is the part matched by the first group (the one whose opening parenthesis comes first in the expression), then the second group, and so on

```
let quotedText = /'([^']*)'/;
console.log(quotedText.exec("she said 'hello'")); // ["'hello'", "hello"]
```

- When a group does not end up being matched at all (for example, when followed by a question mark), its position in the output array will hold `undefined`
- Similarly, when a group is matched multiple times, only the last match ends up in the array

```
console.log(/bad(ly)?/.exec("bad")); // ["bad", undefined]
console.log(/(\d)+/.exec("123")); // ["123", "3"]
```

- Groups can be useful for extracting parts of a string - if we don't just want to verify whether a string contains a date but also extract it and construct an object that represents it, we can wrap parentheses around the digit patterns and directly pick the date out of the result of `exec`

**The Date class**

- JS has a standard class for representing dates - or, rather, points in time
- It is called `Date`
- If you simply create a date object using `new`, you get the current date and time:

```
console.log(new Date());
// Thu Mar 12 2020 14:25:43 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
```

- You can also create an object for a specific time:

```
console.log(new Date(1993, 6, 13));
// Tue Jul 13 1993 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
```

- JS uses a convention where month numbers start at zero (so December is 11), yet day numbers start at one
- The last four arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) are optional and taken to be zero when not given
- Timestamps are stored as the number of milliseconds since the start of 1970, in the UTC time zone (Unix time)
	- You can use negative numbers for times before 1970
	- The `getTime` method on a date object returns this number
- If you give the `Date` constructor a single argument, that argument is treated as such a millisecond count
- You can get the current millisecond count by creating a new `Date` object and calling `getTime` on it or by calling the `Date.now` function:

```
console.log(new Date().getTime());
// 1584020143307
console.log(Date.now());
// 1584020143307
```

- Date objects provide methods such as `getFullYear`, `getMonth`, `getDate`, `getHours`, `getMinutes` and `getSeconds` to extract their components
- Besides `getFullYear` there's also `getYear`, which gives you the year minus 1900 and is mostly useless
- Putting parentheses around the parts of the expression that we are interested in, we can now create a date object from a string:

```
function getDate(string) {
	let [_, month, day, year] = /(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})/.exec(string);
	return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
}

console.log(getDate("7-13-1993"));
// Tue Jul 13 1993 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
```

**Word and string boundaries**

- Unfortunately, `getDate` will also happily extract the nonsensical date 00-1-3000 from the string `"100-1-30000"`
- A match may happen anywhere in the string, so in this case, it'll just start at the second character and end at the second-to-last character
- If we want to enforce that the match must span the whole string, we can add the markers `^` and `$`
- The caret matches the start of the input string, whereas the dollar sign matches the end
- If, on the other hand, we just want to make sure the date starts and ends on a word boundary, we can use the marker `\b`
- A word boundary can be the start or end of the string or any point in the string that has a word character (as in `\w`) on one side and a nonword character on the other

```
console.log(/cat/.test("concatenate")); // true
console.log(/\bcat/.test("concatenate")); // false
```

**Choice patterns**

- Say we want to know whether a piece of text contains not only a number but a number followed by one of the words *pig*, *cow* or *chicken*, or any of their plural forms
- We could write three regular expressions and test them in turn, but there is a nicer way:

```
let animalCount = /\b\d+ (pig|cow|chicken)s?\b/;
console.log(animalCount.test("15 pigs")); // true
console.log(animalCount.test("15 pigchickens")); // false
```

- The pipe character (`|`) denotes a choice between the pattern to its left and the pattern to its right
- Parentheses can be used to limit the part of the pattern that the pipe operator applies to, and you can put multiple such operators next to each other to express a choice between more than two alternatives

**The replace method**

- String values have a replace method that can be used to replace part of the string with another string:

```
console.log("papa".replace(/p/g, "m")); // mama
```

- When a `g` option (for *global*) is added to the regular expression, *all* matches in the string will be replaced, not just the first
- The real power of using regular expressions with replace comes from the fact that we can refer to matched groups in the replacement string

```
console.log(`
Pitt, Brad
Hanks, Tom
Kidman, Nicole
`.trim().replace(/(\w+), (\w+)/g, "$2 $1"));

// Brad Pitt
// Tom Hanks
// Nicole Kidman
```

- The `$1` and `$2` in the replacement string refer to the parenthesized groups in the pattern
- `$1` is replaced by the text that matched against the first group, `$2` by the second, and so on, up to `$9`
- The whole match can be referred to with `$&`
- It is possible to pass a function, rather than a string, as the second argument to `replace`
- For each replacement, the function will be called with the matched groups (as well as the whole match) as arguments, and its return value will be inserted into the new string:

```
let s = "The cia and fbi";
console.log(s.replace(/\b(fbi|cia)\b/g, str => str.toUpperCase()));

// The CIA and FBI
```

**Dynamically creating RegExp objects**

- There are cases where you might not know the exact pattern you need to match against when you are writing your code
- You can build up a string and use the `RegExp` constructor on that:

```
let name = "harry";
let text = "Harry Potter";
let regexp = new RegExp("\\b(" + name + ")\\b", "gi");
console.log(text.replace(regexp, "_$1_")); // _Harry_ Potter
```

- When creating the `\b` boundary markers, we have to use two backslashes because we are writing them in a normal string, not a slash-enclosed regular expression
- The second argument to the `RegExp` constructor contains the options for the regular expression - in this case, `"gi"` for global and case insensitive

**The search method**

- The `indexOf` method on strings cannot be called with a regular expression
- But there is another method, `search`, that does expect a regular expression
- Like `indexOf`, it returns the first index on which the expression was found, or -1 when it wasn't found

```
console.log("foo".search(/f/)); // 0
console.log("foo".search(/o/)); // 1
console.log("bar".search(/o/)); // -1
```

- Unfortunately, there is no way to indicate that the match should start at a given offset, like we can with the second argument to `indexOf`

**Looping over matches**

- A common thing to do is to scan through all occurrences of a pattern in a string, in a way that gives us access to the match object in the loop body
- We can do this by using `index` and `exec`:

```
let input = "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88.";
let number = /\b\d+\b/g;
let match;
while (match = number.exec(input)) {
	console.log("Found", match[0], "at", match.index);
}

// Found 3 at 14
// Found 42 at 33
// Found 88 at 40
```

- This makes use of the fact that the value of an assignment expression (`=`) is the assigned value
- So by using `match = number.exec(input)` as the condition in the `while` statement, we perform the match at the start of each iteration, save its result in a binding, and stop looping when no more matches are found

**International characters**

- JS's regular expressions are rather dumb about characters that do not appear in the English language
- For example, as far as JS's regular expressions are concerned, a "word character" is only one of the 26 characters in the Latin alphabet (uppercase or lowercase), decimal digits, and, for some reason, the underscore character
- Things like *ш* or *ђ*, which most definitely are word characters, will not match `\w` (and will match uppercase `\W`, the nonword category)
- Another problem is that, by default, regular expressions work on code units, not actual characters
- This means characters that are composed of two code units behave strangely
- You must add a `u` option (for Unicode) to your regular expression to make it treat such characters properly

```
console.log(/🍎{3}/.test("🍎🍎🍎")); // false
console.log(/🍎{3}/u.test("🍎🍎🍎")); // true
```
