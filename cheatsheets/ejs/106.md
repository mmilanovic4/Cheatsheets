# The secret life of objects

**Object-oriented programming**

- OOP is a set of techniques that use objects (and related concepts) as the central principle of program organization

**Encapsulation**

- The core idea in OOP is to divide programs into smaller pieces and make each piece responsible for managing its own state
- This way, some knowledge about the way a piece of the program works can be kept *local* to that piece
- Different pieces of such a program interact with each other through *interfaces*, limited sets of functions or bindings that provide useful functionality at a more abstract level, hiding their precise implementation
- Such program pieces are modeled using objects
- Their interface consists of a specific set of methods and properties
	- Properties that are part of the interface are called *public*
	- Properties which outside code should not be touching are called *private*
- Separating interface from implementation is usually called *encapsulation*

**Methods**

- Methods are nothing more than properties that hold function values

```
let rabbit = {};
rabbit.speak = function(line) {
	console.log(`The rabbit says "${line}"`);
};

rabbit.speak("I'm alive."); // The rabbit says "I'm alive."
```

- Usually a method needs to do something with the object it was called on
- When a function is called as a method - looked up as a property and immediately called, as in `object.method()` - the binding called `this` in its body automatically points at the object that it was called on

```
function speak(line) {
	console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
}

let whiteRabbit = { type: "white", speak };
let hungryRabbit = { type: "hungry", speak };

whiteRabbit.speak("Hello!");
// The white rabbit says "Hello!"

hungryRabbit.speak("Hi, I could use a carrot right now.");
// The hungry rabbit says "Hi, I could use a carrot right now."
```

- You can think of `this` as an extra parameter that is passed in a different way
- If you want to pass it explicitly, you can use a function's `call` method, which takes the `this` value as its first argument and treats further arguments as normal parameters

```
speak.call(hungryRabbit, "Burp!");
// The hungry rabbit says "Burp!"
```

- Since each function has its own `this` binding whose value depends on the way it is called, you cannot refer to the `this` of the wrapping scope in a regular function defined with the `function` keyword
- Arrow functions are different - they do not bind their own `this` but can see the `this` binding of the scope around them

```
function normalize() {
	console.log(this.coords.map(n => n / this.length));
}

normalize.call({ coords: [0, 2, 3], length: 5 }); // [0, 0.4, 0.6]
```

**Prototypes**

- In addition to their set of properties, most objects also have a *prototype*
- A prototype is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties - when an object gets a request for a property that it does not have, its prototype will be searched for the property, then the prototype's prototype, and so on
- The entity behind almost all objects is the great ancestral prototype, `Object.prototype`

```
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) == Object.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype)); // null
```

- `Object.getPrototypeOf` returns the prototype of an object
- The prototype relations of JavaScript objects form a tree-shaped structure, and at the root of this structure sits `Object.prototype`
- It provides a few methods that show up in all objects, such as `toString`, which converts an object to a string representation
- Many objects don't directly have `Object.prototype` as their prototype but instead have another object that provides a different set of default properties, e.g.:
	- Functions derive from `Function.prototype`
	- Arrays derive from `Array.prototype`
- Such a prototype object will itself have a prototype, often `Object.prototype`, so that it still indirectly provides methods like `toString`

```
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf([]) == Array.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype) == Object.prototype); // true
```

- You can use `Object.create` to create an object with a specific prototype

```
let protoRabbit = {
	speak(line) {
		console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
	}
};

let killerRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
killerRabbit.type = "killer";
killerRabbit.speak("SKREEE!");
// The killer rabbit says "SKREEE!"
```

- A property like `speak(line)` in an object expression is a shorthand way of defining a method
- It creates a property called `speak` and gives it a function as its value
- The "proto" rabbit acts as a container for the properties that are shared by all rabbits
- An individual rabbit object, like the killer rabbit, contains properties that apply only to itself - in this case its type - and derives shared properties from its prototype

**Classes**

- JavaScript's prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat informal take on an object-oriented concept called classes
- A class defines the shape of a type of object - what methods and properties it has
- Such an object is called an *instance* of the class
- Prototypes are useful for defining properties for which all instances of a class share the same value, such as methods
- Properties that differ per instance, such as our rabbit's `type` property, need to be stored directly in the objects themselves
- So to create an instance of a given class, you have to make an object that derives from the proper prototype, but you *also* have to make sure it, itself, has the properties that instances of this class are supposed to have
- This is what a *constructor* function does

```
function makeRabbit(type) {
	let rabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
	rabbit.type = type;
	return rabbit;
}
```

- JavaScript provides a way to make defining this type of function easier
- If you put the keyword `new` in front of a function call, the function is treated as a constructor
- This means that an object with the right prototype is automatically created, bound to `this` in the function, and returned at the end of the function
- The prototype object used when constructing objects is found by taking the `prototype` property of the constructor function

```
function Rabbit(type) {
	this.type = type;
}
Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
	console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
};

let weirdRabbit = new Rabbit("weird");
```

- Constructors (all functions, in fact) automatically get a property named `prototype`, which by default holds a plain, empty object that derives from `Object.prototype`
- You can overwrite it with a new object if you want, or you can add properties to the existing object
- By convention, the names of constructors are capitalized so that they can easily be distinguished from other functions
- It is important to understand the distinction between the way a prototype is associated with a constructor (through its `prototype` property) and the way objects *have* a prototype (which can be found with `Object.getPrototypeOf`)
- The actual prototype of a constructor is `Function.prototype` since constructors are functions
- Its `prototype` *property* holds the prototype used for instances created through it

```
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Rabbit) == Function.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(weirdRabbit) == Rabbit.prototype); // true
```

**Class notation**

- So JavaScript classes are constructor functions with a prototype property
- That is how they work, and until 2015, that was how you had to write them
- These days, we have a less awkward notation:

```
class Rabbit {
	constructor(type) {
		this.type = type;
	}
	speak(line) {
		console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
	}
}

let killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
let blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");
```

- The `class` keyword starts a class declaration, which allows us to define a constructor and a set of methods all in a single place
- Any number of methods may be written inside the declaration's braces
- The one named `constructor` is treated specially
- It provides the actual constructor function, which will be bound to the class name
- The others are packaged into that constructor's prototype
- Thus, the earlier class declaration is equivalent to the constructor definition from the previous section - it just looks nicer
- Like `function`, `class` can be used both in statements and in expressions
- When used as an expression, it doesn't define a binding but just produces the constructor as a value
- You are allowed to omit the class name in a class expression

```
let object = new class { sayHello() { console.log("Hello!"); } };
object.sayHello();
```

**Overriding derived properties**

- When you add a property to an object, whether it is present in the prototype or not, the property is added to the object *itself*
- If there was already a property with the same name in the prototype, this property will no longer affect the object, as it is now hidden behind the object's own property

```
Rabbit.prototype.teeth = "small";
console.log(killerRabbit.teeth); // small
killerRabbit.teeth = "long, sharp and bloody";
console.log(killerRabbit.teeth); // long, sharp and bloody
```

- Overriding properties that exist in a prototype can be a useful thing to do
- As the rabbit teeth example shows, overriding can be used to express exceptional properties in instances of a more generic class of objects, while letting the nonexceptional objects take a standard value from their prototype
- Overriding is also used to give the standard function and array prototypes a different `toString` method than the basic object prototype

```
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call([1, 2])); // [object Array]
console.log([1, 2].toString()); // [1, 2]
```

**Maps**

- We saw the word *map* used in the previous chapter for an operation that transforms a data structure by applying a function to its elements
- Confusing as it is, in programming the same word is also used for a related but rather different thing
- A *map* (noun) is a data structure that associates values (the keys) with other values
- For example, you might want to map names to ages - it is possible to use objects for this:

```
let ages = {
	Leo: 39,
	Kim: 22,
	Tom: 62
};

console.log("Leo" in ages); // true
console.log("Jack" in ages); // false
console.log("toString" in ages); // true
```

- Here, the object's property names are the people's names, and the property values are their ages - but we certainly didn't list anybody named `toString` in our map
- Yet, because plain objects derive from `Object.prototype`, it looks like the property is there
- As such, using plain objects as maps is dangerous
- First possible way avoid this problem is to create objects with *no* prototype

```
console.log("toString" in Object.create(null)); // false
```

- If you pass `null` to `Object.create`, the resulting object will not derive from `Object.prototype` and can safely be used as a map
- Object property names must be strings	- if you need a map whose keys can't easily be converted to strings - such as objects - you cannot use an object as your map
- Fortunately, JS comes with a class called `Map` that is written for this exact purpose
- It stores a mapping and allows any type of keys

```
let ages = new Map();
ages.set("Leo", 39);
ages.set("Kim", 22);
ages.set("Tom", 62);

console.log(`Leo is ${ages.get("Leo")}.`); // Leo is 39
console.log(ages.has("Jack")); // false
console.log(ages.has("toString")); // false
```

- The methods `set`, `get` and `has` are part of the interface of the `Map` object
- If you do have a plain object that you need to treat as a map for some reason, it is useful to know that `Object.keys` returns only an object's *own* keys, not those in the prototype
- As an alternative to the `in` operator, you can use the `hasOwnProperty` method, which ignores the object's prototype

```
let obj = { x: 1 };
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("x")); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("toString")); // false
```

**Polymorphism**

- When you call the `String` function (which converts a value to a string) on an object, it will call the `toString` method on that object to try to create a meaningful string from it
- Some of the standard prototypes define their own version of toString so they can create a string that contains more useful information than `"[object Object]"`
- You can also do that yourself:

```
Rabbit.prototype.toString = function() {
	return `A ${this.type} rabbit`;
};

console.log(String(blackRabbit)); // A black rabbit
```

- This is a simple instance of a powerful idea
- When a piece of code is written to work with objects that have a certain interface - in this case, a `toString` method - any kind of object that happens to support this interface can be plugged into the code, and it will just work - this technique is called *polymorphism*
- Polymorphic code can work with values of different shapes, as long as they support the interface it expects
- We saw that a `for/of` loop can loop over several kinds of data structures
- This is another case of polymorphism - such loops expect the data structure to expose a specific interface, which arrays and strings do
- We can also add this interface to our own objects - but before we can do that, we need to know what symbols are

**Symbols**

- `typeof`: `symbol`
- It is possible for multiple interfaces to use the same property name for different things
- Property names are strings, but that isn't entirely accurate
- They can also be *symbols*
- Symbols are values created with the `Symbol` function
- Unlike strings, newly created symbols are unique - you cannot create the same symbol twice

```
let sym = Symbol("name");
console.log(sym == Symbol("name")); // false

Rabbit.prototype[sym] = 55;
console.log(blackRabbit[sym]); // 55
```

- The string you pass to `Symbol` is included when you convert it to a string and can make it easier to recognize a symbol when, for example, showing it in the console
- But it has no meaning beyond that - multiple symbols may have the same name
- Being both unique and usable as property names makes symbols suitable for defining interfaces that can peacefully live alongside other properties, no matter what their names are

```
let toStringSym = Symbol("toString");
Array.prototype[toStringSym] = function() {
	return `Array of ${this.length} element(s).`;
};

console.log([1, 2].toString()); // 1,2
console.log([1, 2][toStringSym]()); // Array of 2 element(s)
```

- It is possible to include symbol properties in object expressions and classes by using square brackets around the property name also:

```
let stringObject = {
	[toStringSym]() { return "This is a string object"; }
};
```

**The iterator interface**

- The object given to a `for/of` loop is expected to be *iterable*
- This means it has a method named with the `Symbol.iterator` symbol
- When called, that method should return an object that provides a second interface, *iterator* - this is the actual thing that iterates
- It has a `next` method that returns the next result - that result should be an object with a `value` property that provides the next value, if there is one, and a `done` property, which should be true when there are no more results and false otherwise
- We can directly use this interface ourselves:

```
let okIterator = "OK"[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(okIterator.next());
// {value: "O", done: false}
console.log(okIterator.next());
// {value: "K", done: false}
console.log(okIterator.next());
// {value: undefined, done: true}
```

- Let's implement an iterable data structure:

```
class Matrix {
	constructor(width, height, element = (x, y) => undefined) {
		this.width = width;
		this.height = height;
		this.content = [];

		for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
			for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
				this.content[y * width + x] = element(x, y);
			}
		}
	}

	get(x, y) {
		return this.content[y * this.width + x];
	}

	set(x, y, value) {
		this.content[y * this.width + x] = value;
	}
}

let matrix = new Matrix(2, 2, (x, y) => `[${x}, ${y}]`);
```

- When looping over a matrix, you are usually interested in the position of the elements as well as the elements themselves, so we'll have our iterator produce objects with `x`, `y` and `value` properties

```
class MatrixIterator {
	constructor(matrix) {
		this.x = 0;
		this.y = 0;
		this.matrix = matrix;
	}
	next() {
		if (this.y == this.matrix.height) return { done: true };

		let value = {
			x: this.x,
			y: this.y,
			value: this.matrix.get(this.x, this.y)
		};
		this.x++;

		if (this.x == this.matrix.width) {
			this.x = 0;
			this.y++;
		}
		return { value, done: false };
	}
}
```

- The class tracks the progress of iterating over a matrix in its `x` and `y` properties
- The `next` method starts by checking whether the bottom of the matrix has been reached
- If it hasn't, it *first* creates the object holding the current value and *then* updates its position, moving to the next row if necessary
- Let's set up the `Matrix` class to be iterable now:

```
Matrix.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
	return new MatrixIterator(this);
};
```

- We can now loop over a matrix with `for/of`:

```
for (let {x, y, value} of matrix) {
	console.log(x, y);
	console.log(value);
	console.log('--');
}
```

**Getters, setters and statics**

- Interfaces often consist mostly of methods, but it is also okay to include properties that hold non-function values
- For example, `Map` objects have a `size` property that tells you how many keys are stored in them
- It is not even necessary for such an object to compute and store such a property directly in the instance - even properties that are accessed directly may hide a method call
- Such methods are called *getters*, and they are defined by writing `get` in front of the method name in an object expression or class declaration

```
let varyingSize = {
	get size() {
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
	}
};

console.log(varyingSize.size); // 25
console.log(varyingSize.size); // 32
```

- Whenever someone reads from this object's `size` property, the associated method is called
- You can do a similar thing when a property is written to, using a *setter*

```
class Temperature {
	constructor(celsius) {
		this.celsius = celsius;
	}
	get fahrenheit() {
		return this.celsius * 1.8 + 32;
	}
	set fahrenheit(value) {
		this.celsius = (value - 32) / 1.8;
	}
	static fromFahrenheit(value) {
		return new Temperature((value - 32) / 1.8);
	}
}

let temp = new Temperature(22);
console.log(temp.fahrenheit); // 71.6
temp.fahrenheit = 86;
console.log(temp.celsius); // 30
```

- The `Temperature` class allows you to read and write the temperature in either degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit, but internally it stores only Celsius and automatically converts to and from Celsius in the `fahrenheit` getter and setter
- Sometimes you want to attach some properties directly to your constructor function, rather than to the prototype
- Such methods won't have access to a class instance but can, for example, be used to provide additional ways to create instances
- Inside a class declaration, methods that have `static` written before their name are stored on the constructor
- So the `Temperature` class allows you to write `Temperature.fromFahrenheit(100)` to create a temperature using degrees Fahrenheit

**Inheritance**

- Some matrices are known to be *symmetric* (the value stored at *x, y* is always the same as that at *y, x*)
- Imagine we need a data structure like `Matrix` but one that enforces the fact that the matrix is and remains symmetrical
- We could write it from scratch, but that would involve repeating some code very similar to what we already wrote
- JS's prototype system makes it possible to create a *new* class, much like the old class, but with new definitions for some of its properties
- In OOP terms, this is called *inheritance* - the new class inherits properties and behavior from the old class

```
class SymmetricMatrix extends Matrix {
	constructor(size, element = (x, y) => undefined) {
		super(size, size, (x, y) => {
			if (x < y) return element(y, x);
			else return element(x, y);
		})
	}
	set(x, y, value) {
		super.set(x, y, value);
		if (x != y) {
			super.set(y, x, value);
		}
	}
}

let matrix = new SymmetricMatrix(5, (x, y) => `[${x}, ${y}]`);
console.log(matrix.get(2, 3)); // [3, 2]
```

- The use of the word `extends` indicates that this class shouldn't be directly based on the default `Object` prototype but on some other class
- This is called the *superclass* and the derived class is the *subclass*
- To initialize a `SymmetricMatrix` instance, the constructor calls its superclass's constructor through the `super` keyword
- This is necessary because if this new object is to behave (roughly) like a `Matrix`, it is going to need the instance properties that matrices have
- The `set` method again uses `super` but this time not to call the constructor but to call a specific method from the superclass's set of methods
- Inside class methods, `super` provides a way to call methods as they were defined in the superclass
- Inheritance allows us to build slightly different data types from existing data types with relatively little work
- Alongside encapsulation and polymorphism, inheritance is a fundamental part of the OOP tradition
- But, while the first two are now generally regarded as wonderful ideas, inheritance is more controversial
- Whereas encapsulation and polymorphism can be used to *separate* pieces of code from each other, reducing the tangledness of the overall program, inheritance fundamentally ties classes together, creating *more* tangle
- When inheriting from a class, you usually have to know more about how it works than when simply using it
- Inheritance can be a useful tool, but it shouldn't be the first tool you reach for, and you probably shouldn't actively go looking for opportunities to construct class hierarchies

**The instanceof operator**

- It is occasionally useful to know whether an object was derived from a specific class
- For this, JS provides a binary operator called `instanceof`

```
console.log(new SymmetricMatrix(2) instanceof SymmetricMatrix); // true

console.log(new SymmetricMatrix(2) instanceof Matrix); // true

console.log(new Matrix(2, 2) instanceof SymmetricMatrix); // false

console.log([1] instanceof Array); // true

console.log([1] instanceof Object); // true
```

- The operator will see through inherited types, so a `SymmetricMatrix` is an instance of `Matrix`
