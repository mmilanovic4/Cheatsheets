# What is JavaScript?

- JS was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser
- The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers
- It is important to note that JS has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java!
	- When JS was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity
	- Someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success
	- Now we are stuck with the name
- After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JS language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JS were actually talking about the same language
	- This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization
	- In practice, ECMAScript (ES) = JavaScript (JS)
- There have been several versions of JS:
	- ECMAScript version 3 was the widely supported version in the time of JS's ascent to dominance (2000-2010)
	- During this time, work was underway on an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical improvements and extensions to the language
	- Changing a living, widely used language in such a radical way turned out to be politically difficult, and work on the version 4 was abandoned (2008), leading to a much less ambitious version 5, which made only some uncontroversial improvements (2009)
	- Then version 6 came out, a major update that included some of the ideas planned for version 4 (2015)
	- Since then we've had new, small updates every year
- The fact that the language is evolving means that browsers have to constantly keep up, and if you're using an older browser, it may not support every feature
	- The language designers are careful to not make any changes that could break existing programs, so new browsers can still run old programs
- Web browsers are not the only platforms on which JS is used:
	- Some databases (MongoDB, CouchDB) use JS as their scripting and query language
	- Several platforms for desktop and server programming (most notably the Node.js project) provide an environment for programming JS outside of the browser
