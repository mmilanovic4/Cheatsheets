# Higher-order functions

**Abstraction**

- Which program is more likely to contain a bug?
- The first is self-contained and six lines long:

```
let total = 0, count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
	total += count;
	count += 1;
}
console.log(total);
```

- The second relies on two external functions and is one line long:

```
console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
```

- If we count the size of the definitions of `sum` and `range`, the second program is also big - even bigger than the first
- But still, I'd argue that it is more likely to be correct, because the solution is expressed in a vocabulary that corresponds to the problem being solved
- Summing a range of numbers isn't about loops and counters, it is about ranges and sums
- The definitions of this vocabulary (the functions `sum` and `range`) will still involve loops, counters and other incidental details
- But because they are expressing simpler concepts than the program as a whole, they are easier to get right
- In the context of programming, these kinds of vocabularies are usually called *abstractions*
- Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level

**Abstracting repetition**

- It is common for a program to do something a given number of times - can we abstract "doing something *n* times" as a function?

```
function repeatLog(n) {
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		console.log(i);
	}
}

repeatLog(3);
```

- But what if we want to do something other than logging the numbers?
- Since "doing something" can be represented as a function and functions are just values, we can pass our action as a function value

```
function repeat(n, action) {
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		action(i);
	}
}

repeat(3, console.log);
```

**Higher-order functions**

- Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called *higher-order functions*
- HOF allow us to abstract over *actions*, not just values
- There is a built-in array method, `forEach`, that provides something like a `for/of` loop as a HOF

```
["A", "B"].forEach(l => console.log(l));
```

**Filtering arrays**

- This function filters out the elements in an array that don't pass a test:

```
function filter(array, test) {
	let passed = [];
	for (let element of array) {
		if (test(element)) {
			passed.push(element);
		}
	}
	return passed;
}

console.log(filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x => x % 2 == 0)); // [2, 4]
```

- The function uses the argument named test, a function value, to fill a "gap" in the computation - the process of deciding which elements to collect
- Note how the `filter` function, rather than deleting elements from the existing array, builds up a new array with only the elements that pass the test
- This function is *pure* - it does not modify the array it is given
- Like `forEach`, `filter` is a standard array method - the example defined the function only to show what it does internally

```
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(x => x % 2 == 0)); // [2, 4]
```

**Transforming with map**

- The `map` method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values
- The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been *mapped* to a new form by the function

```
function map(array, transform) {
	let mapped = [];
	for (let element of array) {
		mapped.push(transform(element));
	}
	return mapped;
}

console.log(map([
	{ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
	{ firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }
], p => `${p.firstName} ${p.lastName}`)); // ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]
```

- Like `forEach` and `filter`, `map` is a standard array method

```
console.log([
	{ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
	{ firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }
].map(p => `${p.firstName} ${p.lastName}`)); // ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]
```

**Summarizing with reduce**

- Another common thing to do with arrays is to compute a single value from them - our recurring example, summing a collection of numbers, is an instance of this
- The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called *reduce* (sometimes also called *fold*)
- It builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value
- The parameters to `reduce` are, apart from the array, a combining function and a start value

```
function reduce(array, combine, start) {
	let current = start;
	for (let element of array) {
		current = combine(current, element);
	}
	return current;
}

console.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], (x, y) => x + y, 0)); // 10
```

- The standard array method `reduce`, which corresponds to this function, has an added convenience
- If your array contains at least one element, you are allowed to leave off the `start` argument - the method will take the first element of the array as its start value and start reducing at the second element

```
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4].reduce((x, y) => x + y, 0)); // 10
```

**Composability**

- HOFs start to shine when you need to *compose* operations

```
function average(array) {
	return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / array.length;
}

const people = [
	{ name: "John", gender: "M", age: 20 },
	{ name: "Jane", gender: "F", age: 18 },
	{ name: "Leo", gender: "M", age: 32 },
	{ name: "Kate", gender: "F", age: 20 },
	{ name: "Tom", gender: "M", age: 24 }
];

console.log(Math.round(average(
	people.filter(p => p.gender == "M").map(p => p.age)
)));
```

- You could definitely also write this computation as one big loop...

```
const people = [
	{ name: "John", gender: "M", age: 20 },
	{ name: "Jane", gender: "F", age: 18 },
	{ name: "Leo", gender: "M", age: 32 },
	{ name: "Kate", gender: "F", age: 20 },
	{ name: "Tom", gender: "M", age: 24 }
];

let total = 0, count = 0;

for (let person of people) {
	if (person.gender == "M") {
		total += person.age;
		count += 1;
	}
}

console.log(Math.round(total / count));
```

- ...but it is harder to see what was being computed and how
- And because intermediate results aren't represented as coherent values, it'd be a lot more work to extract something like `average` into a separate function
- In terms of what the computer is actually doing, these two approaches are also quite different
- The first will build up new arrays when running `filter` and `map`, whereas the second computes only some numbers, doing less work
- You can usually afford the readable approach, but if you're processing huge arrays and doing so many times, the less abstract style might be worth the  extra speed

**Strings and character codes**

- JS strings are encoded as a sequence of 16-bit numbers
	- These are called *code units*
- UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format)
- UTF-16 describes most common characters using a single 16-bit code unit but uses a pair of two such units for others
- UTF-16 is generally considered a bad idea today - it seems almost intentionally designed to invite mistakes
- It's easy to write programs that pretend code units and characters are the same thing, and if your language doesn't use two-unit characters, that will appear to work just fine
- But as soon as someone tries to use such a program with some less common Chinese characters or emoji, it breaks
- Unfortunately, obvious operations on JS strings, such as getting their length through the `length` property and accessing their content using square brackets, deal only with code units

```
let panda = "üêº"; // Panda emoji character

console.log(panda.length); // 2

console.log(panda[0]); // Invalid half-character

console.log(panda.charCodeAt(0)); // Code of the half-character

console.log(panda.codePointAt(0)); // Actual code for panda emoji
```

- JS's `charCodeAt` method gives you a code unit, not a full character code
- The `codePointAt` method, added later, does give a full Unicode character
- The `for/of` loop can be used on strings

```
let pandaLion = "üêºü¶Å";

for (let char of pandaLion) {
	console.log(char);
}
```
