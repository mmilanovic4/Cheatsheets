# Functions

**Defining a function**

- `function` keyword

```
const square = function(x) {
	return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12)); // 144
```

- A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword `function`
- Functions have a set of *parameters* (in this case, only `x`) and a *body*, which contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called
- The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in braces, even when it consists of only a single statement
- A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all

```
const sayHello = function() {
	console.log("Hello!");
};

sayHello();

const power = function(base, exponent) {
	let result = 1;
	for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
		result *= base;
	}
	return result;
}

console.log(power(2, 10));
```

- Some functions produce a value, such as `power` and `square`, and some don't, such as `sayHello`, whose only result is a side effect
- A `return` statement determines the value the function returns
- When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function
- A `return` keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return `undefined`
- Functions that don't have a `return` statement at all, such as `sayHello`, similarly return `undefined`
- Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial values are given by the *caller* of the function, not the code in the function itself

**Bindings and scopes**

- Each binding has a *scope*, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible
- For bindings defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program - you can refer to such bindings wherever you want
	- These are called *global* bindings
- Bindings created for function parameters or declared inside a function can be referenced only in that function
	- These are called *local* bindings
- Bindings declared with `let` and `const` are in fact local to the `block` that they are declared in, so if you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot "see" it
- In pre-2015 JavaScript, only functions created new scopes, so old-style bindings, created with the `var` keyword, are visible throughout the whole function that they appear in - or throughout the global scope, if they are not in a function
- For example, when the code inside the `halve` function refers to `n`, it is seeing its *own* `n`, not the global `n`

```
const halve = function(n) {
	return n / 2;
};

let n = 10;
console.log(halve(100)); // 50
console.log(n); // 10
```

**Nested scope**

- JavaScript distinguishes not just global and local bindings
- Blocks and functions can be created inside other blocks and functions, producing multiple degrees of locality
- The set of bindings visible inside a block is determined by the place of that block in the program text
- Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that contain it, and all scopes can see the global scope
- This approach to binding visibility is called *lexical scoping*

**Functions as values**

- A function binding usually simply acts as a name for a specific piece of the program
- Such a binding is defined once and never changed
- This makes it easy to confuse the function and its name
- But the two are different - a function value can do all the things that other values can do
- It is possible to store a function value in a new binding, pass it as an argument to a function etc.
- Similarly, a binding that holds a function is still just a regular binding and can, if not constant, be assigned a new value

**Declaration notation**


- A slightly shorter way to create a function binding
- When the `function` keyword is used at the start of a statement, it works differently

```
function square(x) {
	return x * x;
}
```

- This is a function *declaration*
- The statement defines the binding `square` and points it at the given function
- It doesn't require a semicolon after the function
- Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control
- They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope

```
console.log(`The future says: ${future()}`);

function future() {
	return "You'll never have flying cars.";
}
```

**Arrow functions**

- There's a third notation for functions, which looks very different from the others
- Arrow functions were added in 2015, to make it possible to write small function expressions in a less verbose way
- Instead of the `function` keyword, it uses an arrow (`=>`)

```
const square = (x) => {
	return x * x;
};
```

- The arrow comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the function's body
- When there is only one parameter name, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list
- If the body is a single expression, rather than a block in braces, that expression will be returned from the function

```
const square = x => x * x;
```

**The call stack**

```
function greet(who) {
	console.log(`Hello ${who}!`);
}
greet("John");
console.log("Bye.");
```

- We could show the flow of control schematically like this:

```
- not in function
	- in greet
		- in console.log
	- in greet
- not in function
	- in console.log
- not in function
```

- Because a function has to jump back to the place that called it when it returns, the computer must remember the context from which the call happened
- In one case, `console.log` has to return to the `greet` function when it is done
- In the other case, it returns to the end of the program
- The place where the computer stores this context is the *call stack*
- Every time a function is called, the current context is stored on top of this stack
- When a function returns, it removes the top context from the stack and uses that context to continue execution

**Optional arguments**

- The following code is allowed and executes without any problem:

```
function square(x) { return x * x; }
console.log(square(4, true, "foo")); // 16
```

- We defined `square` with only one parameter, yet when we call it with three, the language doesn't complain - it ignores the extra arguments and computes the square of the first one
- On the other hand, if you pass too few parameters, the missing ones get assigned the value `undefined`
- The downside: you'll accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions, and no one will tell you about it
- The upside: this behavior can be used to allow a function to be called with different numbers of arguments, e.g.:

```
function minus(a, b) {
	if (b === undefined) return -a;
	else return a - b;
}

console.log(minus(10)); // -10
console.log(minus(10, 5)); // 5
```

- The `minus` function tries to imitate the `-` operator by acting on either one or two arguments
- If you write an `=` operator after a parameter, followed by an expression, the value of that expression will replace the argument when it is not given
- For example, this version of `power` makes its second argument optional - if you don't provide it or pass the value `undefined`, it will default to two, and the function will behave like `square`

```
const power = function(base, exponent = 2) {
	let result = 1;
	for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
		result *= base;
	}
	return result;
}

console.log(power(4)); // 16
console.log(power(2, 6)); // 64
```

**Closure**

- What happens to local bindings when the function call that created them is no longer active?

```
function wrapValue(n) {
	let local = n;
	return () => local;
}

let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
let wrap2 = wrapValue(2);

console.log(wrap1()); // 1
console.log(wrap2()); // 2
```

- Local bindings are created anew for every call
- Different calls can't trample on one another's local bindings
- This feature - being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope - is called *closure*
- A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure
- This behavior not only frees you from having to worry about lifetimes of bindings but also makes it possible to use function values in some creative ways

```
function multiplier(factor) {
	return number => number * factor;
}

let twice = multiplier(2);
console.log(twice(5)); // 10
```

- A good mental model is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created

**Recursion**

- It is perfectly okay for a function to call itself, as long as it doesn't do it so often that it overflows the stack
- A function that calls itself is called *recursive*

```
function power(base, exponent) {
	if (exponent == 0) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
	}
}

console.log(power(2, 3)); // 8
```

- Take, for example, this alternative implementation of `power`
- Arguably this describes the concept more clearly than the looping variant
- But there is one problem - in typical JavaScript implementations, it's *n* times slower than the looping version
- Running through a simple loop is generally cheaper than calling a function multiple times (The dilemma of speed versus elegance)

**Growing functions**

- We want to write a program that prints two numbers: the numbers of cows and chickens on a farm, with the words `Cows` and `Chickens` before them and zeros padded before both numbers so that they are always three digits long

```
function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens) {
	let cowString = String(cows);
	while (cowString.length < 3) {
		cowString = '0' + cowString;
	}
	console.log(`Cows: ${cowString}`);

	let chickenString = String(chickens);
	while (chickenString.length < 3) {
		chickenString = '0' + chickenString;
	}
	console.log(`Chickens: ${chickenString}`);
}

printFarmInventory(7, 11);
```

- What if we want to extend the software to also print pigs?
- You'll find yourself writing similar code multiple times and you'd prefer not to do that
- Having more code means more space for mistakes to hide and more material to read for people trying to understand the program
- So you take the repeated functionality, find a good name for it, and put it into a function

```
function printZeroPaddedWithLabel(number, label) {
	let numberString = String(number);
	while (numberString.length < 3) {
		numberString = '0' + numberString;
	}
	console.log(`${label}: ${numberString}`);
}

function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens, pigs) {
	printZeroPaddedWithLabel(cows, "Cows");
	printZeroPaddedWithLabel(chickens, "Chickens");
	printZeroPaddedWithLabel(pigs, "Pigs");
}

printFarmInventory(7, 11, 3);
```

- It works! But that name, `printZeroPaddedWithLabel`, is a little awkward
- Instead of lifting out the repeated part of our program wholesale, let's try to pick out a single *concept*

```
function zeroPad(number, width) {
	let string = String(number);
	while (string.length < width) {
		string = '0' + string;
	}
	return string;
}

function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens, pigs) {
	console.log(`Cows: ${zeroPad(cows, 3)}`);
	console.log(`Chickens: ${zeroPad(chickens, 3)}`);
	console.log(`Pigs: ${zeroPad(pigs, 3)}`);
}

printFarmInventory(7, 11, 3);
```

- A function with a nice, obvious name like `zeroPad` makes it easier for someone who reads the code to figure out what it does
- How smart and versatile *should* our function be?
- A useful principle is to not add cleverness unless you are absolutely sure you're going to need it
- It can be tempting to write general "frameworks" for every bit of functionality you come across - resist that urge - you won't get any real work done, you'll just be writing code that you never use

**Functions and side effects**

- Functions can be roughly divided into those that are called for their side effects and those that are called for their return value
	- Though it is definitely also possible to both have side effects and return a value!
- A *pure* function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only has no side effects but also doesn't rely on side effects from other code - for example, it doesn't read global bindings whose value might change
- A pure function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value (and doesn't do anything else)
- A call to such a function can be substituted by its return value without changing the meaning of the code
- When you are not sure that a pure function is working correctly, you can test it by simply calling it and know that if it works in that context, it will work in any context - nonpure functions tend to require more scaffolding to test
- Still, there's no need to feel bad when writing functions that are not pure or to wage a holy war to purge them from your code - side effects are often useful
- Some operations are easier to express in an efficient way when we use side effects, so computing speed can be a reason to avoid purity
