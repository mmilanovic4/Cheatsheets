# Program structure

**Expressions and statements**

- Expression: a fragment of code that produces a value
- Every value that is written literally (e.g. 1389 or "JavaScript") is an expression
- A program is a list of statements
- The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it:

```
1;
```

**Bindings**

- To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or *variable*:
	- `let ten = 10;`
	- `let ten = 5 * 2;`
- Keyword `let` indicate that this statement is going to define a binding
- Name of the binding (in this case `ten`)
- After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression:

```
let ten = 10;
console.log(ten * ten); // 100
```

- When a binding points at a value, that doesn't mean it is tied to that value forever:

```
let theme = "light";
theme = "dark";
console.log(theme); // dark
```

- A single `let` statement may define multiple bindings:

```
let one = 1, two = 2, unknown;
console.log(one); // 1
console.log(two); // 2
console.log(unknown); // undefined
```

- Keyword `const` defines a constant binding, which points at the same value for as long as it lives

**Binding names**

- Binding names can be any word
- Digits can be part of binding names, but the name must not start with a digit
- Binding name may include dollar signs (`$`) or underscores (`_`)
- Words with a special meaning, such as `let` or `const`, are *keywords* and they may not be used as a binding names

**The environment**

- Set of bindings that are defined
- JavaScript systems always put a number of useful standard bindings into your environment
- e.g. in a browser there are functions to interact with the currently loaded website and to read mouse and keyboard input

**Functions**

- `typeof function`
- A piece of program wrapped in a value
- Such values can be applied in order to run the wrapped program
- For example, in a browser environment, the binding `prompt` holds a function that shows a little dialog box asking for user input and it is used like this:

```
prompt("Enter password:")
```

- Executing a function is called *invoking*, *calling* or *applying* it
- You can call a function by putting parentheses after an expression that produces a function value
- The values between the parentheses are given to the program inside the function
- In the example, the `prompt` function uses the string that we give it as the text to show in the dialog box
- Values given to functions are called *arguments* or *parameters*

**Return values**

- Functions may produce *values* or *side effects*
- Side effects: showing a dialog box (`prompt`) or writing text to the screen (`console.log`)
- On the other hand, when a function produces a value, it is said to *return* that value
- For example, the function `Math.max` takes any amount of number arguments and gives back the greatest

```
console.log(Math.max(2, 4));
```

**Conditional execution**

- `if` keyword
- We want some code to be executed if, and only if, a certain condition holds
- We might, for example, want to show the square of the input only if the input is actually a number

```
let x = Number(prompt("Pick a number:"));
if (!Number.isNaN(x)) {
	console.log(`Your number is the square root of ${x * x}`);
}
```

- The `if` keyword executes or skips a statement depending on the value of a Boolean expression
- The deciding expression is written after the keyword, between parentheses, followed by the statement to execute
- The braces (`{` and `}`) can be used to group any number of statements into a single statement, called a *block*
- You can omit the braces for the one-liners, e.g.:

```
if (1 + 1 == 2) console.log("1 + 1 is 2.");
```

- You often won't just have code that executes when a condition holds true, but also code that handles the other case

```
let x = Number(prompt("Pick a number:"));
if (!Number.isNaN(x)) {
	console.log(`Your number is the square root of ${x * x}`);
} else {
	console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a  number?");
}
```

- If you have more than two paths to choose from, you can "chain" multiple `if`/`else` pairs together

```
let x = Number(prompt("Pick a number:"));

if (Number.isNaN(x)) {
	console.log("Not a number.");
}	else if (x < 10) {
	console.log("Small.");
} else if (x < 100) {
	console.log("Medium.");
} else {
	console.log("Large.");
}
```

**While and do loops**

- `while` keyword
- Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it with our current program state

```
let x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
	console.log(x);
	x = x + 2;
}
```

- The word `while` is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement
- The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives `true` when converted to Boolean
- A `do` loop is a control structure similar to a `while` loop
- It differs only on one point: a `do` loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing whether it should stop only after that first execution

```
let yourName;
do {
	yourName = prompt("Who are you?");
} while (!yourName) {
	console.log(yourName);
}
```

**For loops**

- `for` keyword

```
for (let x = 0; x <= 10; x = x + 2) {
	console.log(x);
}
```

- The parentheses after a `for` keyword must contain two semicolons
- The part before the first semicolon *initializes* the loop, usually by defining a binding
- The second part is the expression that *checks* whether the loop must continue
- The final part *updates* the state of the loop after every iteration
- In most cases, this is shorter and clearer than a `while` construct

**Breaking out of a loop**

- `break` keyword
- Having the looping condition produce `false` is not the only way a loop can finish
- There is a special statement that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop

```
for (let x = 20; ; x = x + 1) {
	if (x % 7 == 0) {
		console.log(x);
		break;
	}
}
```

- The `for` construct in the example does not have a part that checks for the end of the loop
- This means that the loop will never stop unless the `break` statement inside is executed
- The `continue` keyword is similar to `break`
- When `continue` is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of the body and continues with the loop's next iteration

**Updating bindings succinctly**

- Especially when looping, a program often needs to "update" a binding to hold a value based on that binding's previous value, e.g.:

```
x = x + 1
```

- JavaScript provides a shortcut for this:

```
x += 1
```

- Similar shortcuts work for many other operators (`y *= 2`, `z -= 5`...)
- For `x += 1` and `x -= 1` there are even shorter equivalents:
	- `x++`
	- `x--`

**Dispatching on a value with switch**

- `switch` keyword

```
switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
	case "rainy":
		console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
		break;
	case "sunny":
		console.log("Dress lightly.");
	case "cloudy":
		console.log("Go outside.");
		break;
	default:
		console.log("Unknown weather type!");
}
```

- You may put any number of `case` labels inside the block opened by `switch`
- The program will start executing at the label that corresponds to the value that `switch` was given, or at `default` if no matching value is found
- It will continue executing, even across other labels, until it reaches a `break` statement
- In some cases, such as the `"sunny"` case in the example, this can be used to share some code between cases (it recommends going outside for both sunny and cloudy weather)
- But be careful - it is easy to forget such a `break`, which will cause the program to execute code you do not want executed

**Capitalization**

- Binding names may not contain spaces, yet it is often helpful to use multiple words to clearly describe what the binding represents
- These are pretty much your choices for writing a binding name with several words in it:
	- `fuzzylittleturtle`
	- `fuzzy_little_turtle`
	- `FuzzyLittleTurtle`
	- `fuzzyLittleTurtle`
- The standard JavaScript functions, and most JavaScript programmers, follow the bottom style
- Capitalize every word except the first (*Camel case*)

**Comments**

- A piece of text that is part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer

```
// Single-line comment

/*
	Multi-line comment
 */
```
