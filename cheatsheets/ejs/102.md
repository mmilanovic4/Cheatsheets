# Program structure

**Expressions and statements**

- Expression: a fragment of code that produces a value
- Every value that is written literally (e.g. 1389 or "JavaScript") is an expression
- A program is a list of statements
- The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it:

```
1;
```

**Bindings**

- To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or *variable*:
	- `let ten = 10;`
	- `let ten = 5 * 2;`
- Keyword `let` indicate that this statement is going to define a binding
- Name of the binding (in this case `ten`)
- After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression:

```
let ten = 10;
console.log(ten * ten); // 100
```

- When a binding points at a value, that doesn't mean it is tied to that value forever:

```
let theme = "light";
theme = "dark";
console.log(theme); // dark
```

- A single `let` statement may define multiple bindings:

```
let one = 1, two = 2, unknown;
console.log(one); // 1
console.log(two); // 2
console.log(unknown); // undefined
```

- Keyword `const` defines a constant binding, which points at the same value for as long as it lives

**Binding names**

- Binding names can be any word
- Digits can be part of binding names, but the name must not start with a digit
- Binding name may include dollar signs (`$`) or underscores (`_`)
- Words with a special meaning, such as `let` or `const`, are *keywords* and they may not be used as a binding names
