# Values, types and operators

**Numbers**

- `typeof`: `number`
- Integers
	- `13`
- Real numbers
	- `9.81`
	- Scientific notation: `2.998e8` (which is equal to 2.998 * 10^8 = 299,800,000)
- Calculations with integers smaller than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` are guaranteed to be precise
- Calculations with real numbers are generally not precise

**Arithmetic**

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Order of operations - PEMDAS:
	- Parentheses: `(` and `)`
	- Exponents (powers and roots)
	- Multiplication or division
	- Addition or subtraction
	- Otherwise just go left to right
- Modulo operation: `%`
	- Same precedence as that of multiplication or division
- Special numbers:
	- `Infinity`
	- `-Infinity`
	- `NaN`
- **Tip:** any number divided by zero is equal to `Infinity`
- **Tip:** `Infinity - Infinity` is equal to `NaN`

**Strings**

- `typeof`: `string`
- Used to represent text
- They are written by enclosing their content in quotes:
	- Single quotes: `'Speak softly and carry a big stick.'`
	- Double quotes: `"Whatever you are, be a good one."`
	- Backticks: `` `I did not have sexual relations with that woman.` ``
- Escape character: `\`
	- `\\` - backslash
	- `\n` - new line
- Concatenation: `+`
- Backtick-quoted strings:
	- Usually called *template literals*
	- You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation
	- e.g. `` `Half of 100 is ${100  / 2}` `` = `Half of 100 is 50`

**Operators**

- Unary operators are operators that use one value
	- e.g. `typeof 5`
- Binary operators are operators that use two values
	- e.g. `5 + 2`
- Some operators can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator
	- e.g. `-10` and `5 - 2`
- Ternary operators - conditional operator:
	- e.g. `true ? 1 : 2`

**Boolean values**

- `typeof`: `boolean`
- Two possibilities ("yes" and "no", "on" and "off")
- Values: `true` and `false`

**Comparison operators**

- Equality: `==`
- Inequality: `!=`
- Identity/strict equality: `===`
- Non-identity/strict inequality: `!==`
- Greater than operator: `>`
- Greater than or equal operator: `>=`
- Less than operator: `<`
- Less than or equal operator: `<=`
- **Tip:** you can compare strings as well (JS goes over the characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes one by one)
- **Tip:** only value in JS that is not equal to itself is `NaN`: `NaN !== NaN`

**Logical operators**

- Logical AND: `&&`
	- e.g. `(true && false) === false`
- Logical OR: `||`
	- e.g. `(true || false) === true`
- Logical NOT: `!`
	- e.g. `!true === false`

**Empty values**

- `null`
	- Represents that some value is missing intentionally
- `undefined`
	- Represents that some value is missing unintentionally

**Automatic type conversion**

- Also called *type coercion*, e.g.:
	- `(8 * null) === 0` (`null` becomes `0`)
	- `("5" - 1) === 4` (`"5"` is converted to `5`)
	- `("5" + 1) === "51"` (`1` is converted to `"1"`)
- When `null` or `undefined` occurs on either side of the operator, it produces true only if both sides are one of `null` or `undefined`
	- `(null == 0) === false`
	- `(null == undefined) === true`

**Short-circuiting of logical operators**

- The `&&` operator will return the value to its left when that can be converted to false and will return the value on its right otherwise, e.g.:
	- `(null && "John") === null`
	- `(!null && "John") === "John"`
- The `||` operator will return the value to its left when that can be converted to true and will return the value on its right otherwise
	- `(null || "user") === "user"`
	- `("John" || "user") === "John"`
- Right part of the expression is evaluated only when necessary
	- In case of `true || X`, no matter what X is, the result will be true and X is never evaluated
- The conditional operator works in similiar way
