# Data structures: objects and arrays

**Data structures**

- Objects allow us to group values - including other objects - to build more complex structures
- Numbers, booleans and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from

**Data sets**

- Say, for example, that we want to represent a collection of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11
- JS provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values
- It is called an *array* and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas

```
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]); // 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]); // 0
```

- The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets
- The first index of an array is zero, not one, so the first element is retrieved with `listOfNumbers[0]`

**Properties**

- We've seen expressions like `myString.length` (to get the length of a string) and `Math.max` (the maximum function) in past lessons
- These are expressions that access a *property* of some value
- In the first case, we access the `length` property of the value in `myString`
- In the second case, we access the property named `max` in the `Math` object (which is a collection of mathematics-related constants and functions)
- **Pro tip:** almost all JS values have properties, the exceptions are `null` and `undefined`
- The two main ways to access properties in JS are with a dot (`value.x`) and with square brackets (`value[x]`)
- The difference is in how `x` is interpreted
- When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property
- When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is *evaluated* to get the property name
- So if you know that the property you are interested in is called *color*, you say `value.color`
- If you want to extract the property named by the value held in the binding `i`, you say `value[i]`
- The dot notation works only with names that look like valid binding names - if you want to access a property named 2 or John Doe, you must use square brackets (`value[2]` or `value["John Doe"]`)
- The elements in an array are stored as the array's properties, using numbers as property names
- Because you can't use the dot notation with numbers and usually want to use a binding that holds the index anyway, you have to use the bracket notation to get at them
- The `length` property of an array tells us how many elements it has

**Methods**

- Both string and array values contain, in addition to the `length` property, a number of properties that hold function values

```
let foo = "Foo";
console.log(typeof foo.toUpperCase); // function
console.log(foo.toUpperCase()); // FOO
```

- Every string has a `toUpperCase` property - when called, it will return a copy of the string in which all letters have been converted to uppercase
	- There is also `toLowerCase`, going the other way
- Interestingly, even though the call to toUpperCase does not pass any arguments, the function somehow has access to the string `"Foo"`, the value whose property we called
- Properties that contain functions are generally called *methods* of the value they belong to, as in "`toUpperCase` is a method of a string"
- This example demonstrates two methods you can use to manipulate arrays

```
let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
sequence.push(4);
sequence.push(5);
console.log(sequence); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sequence.pop()); // 5
console.log(sequence); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- The `push` method adds values to the end of an array, and the `pop` method does the opposite, removing the last value in the array and returning it
- **Pro tip:** this two names are the traditional terms for operations on a *stack*
- A stack, in programming, is a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first (LIFO - last in, first out)

**Objects**

- Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties
- One way to create an object is by using braces as an expression:

```
let person = {
	firstName: "John",
	age: 30
};

console.log(person.firstName); // John

console.log(person.lastName); // undefined
person.lastName = "Doe";
console.log(person.lastName); // Doe
```

- Inside the braces, there is a list of properties separated by commas
- Each property has a name followed by a colon and a value
- Reading a property that doesn't exist will give you the value `undefined`
- It is possible to assign a value to a property expression with the `=` operator - this will replace the property's value if it already existed or create a new property on the object if it didn't
- Properties whose names aren't valid binding names or valid numbers have to be quoted, e.g.:

```
let obj = {
	"first name": "John"
};
```

- The `delete` operator is a unary operator that, when applied to an object property, will remove the named property from the object

```
let obj = { left: 1, right: 2 };
console.log(obj.left); // 1

delete obj.left;
console.log(obj.left); // undefined

console.log("left" in obj); // false
console.log("right" in obj); // true
```

- The `in` operator is a binary operator that, when applied to an object, tells you whether that object has a property with that name
- The difference between setting a property to `undefined` and actually deleting it is that, in the first case, the object still *has* the property (it just doesn't have a very interesting value), whereas in the second case the property is no longer present and `in` will return `false`
- To find out what properties an object has, you can use the `Object.keys` function:

```
console.log(Object.keys({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })); // ["x", "y", "z"]
```

- There's an `Object.assign` function that copies all properties from one object into another:

```
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
Object.assign(obj, { b: 3, c: 4 });
console.log(obj); // {a: 1, b: 3, c: 4}
```

- Arrays are just a kind of object specialized for storing sequences of things
- If you evaluate `typeof []`, it produces `"object"`
- Arrays have an `includes` method that checks whether a given value exists in the array:

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];

console.log(arr.includes(1)); // true
console.log(arr.includes(4)); // false
```

**Mutability**

- We saw that object values can be modified
- The types of values discussed in earlier chapters (e.g. numbers, strings and booleans) are all immutable - it is impossible to change values of those types
- Objects work differently - you *can* change their properties, causing a single object value to have different content at different times
- When we have two numbers, 120 and 120, we can consider them precisely the same number, whether or not they refer to the same physical bits
- With objects, there is a difference between having two references to the same object and having two different objects that contain the same properties

```
let obj1 = { value: 10 };
let obj2 = obj1;
let obj3 = { value: 10 };

console.log(obj1 == obj2); // true
console.log(obj1 == obj3); // false

obj1.value = 15;
console.log(obj2.value); // 15
console.log(obj3.value); // 10
```

- The `obj1` and `obj2` bindings grasp the *same* object, which is why changing `obj1` also changes the value of `obj2`
- They are said to have the same *identity*
- The binding `obj3` points to a different object, which initially contains the same properties as `obj1` but lives a separate life
- A `const` binding to an object can itself not be changed and will continue to point at the same object, but the *contents* of that object might change, e.g.:

```
const score = { home: 0, visitors: 0 };

// This is okay
score.visitors = 1;

// This isn't allowed
score = { home: 1, visitors: 1 };
```

- When you compare objects with JS's `==` operator, it compares by identity: it will produce `true` only if both objects are precisely the same value
- Comparing different objects will return `false`, even if they have identical properties:

```
console.log({ a: 1 } == { a: 1 }); // false
console.log([1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]); // false
```

- If a property name in brace notation isn't followed by a value, its value is taken from the binding with the same name:

```
let firstName = "John", lastName = "Doe";

const obj = {
	firstName,
	lastName
};

console.log(`${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`); // John Doe
```

**Array loops**

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

- This kind of loop is common in classical JS - going over arrays one element at a time
- There is a simpler way to write such loops in modern JS

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];

for (let x of arr) {
	console.log(x);
}
```

- When a `for` loop looks like this, with the word `of` after a variable definition, it will loop over the elements of the value given after `of`
- This works not only for arrays but also for strings and some other data structures

**Further arrayology**

- We saw `push` and `pop`, which add and remove elements at the end of an array
- The corresponding methods for adding and removing things at the start of an array are called `unshift` and `shift`

```
let todoList = [];

function remember(task) {
	todoList.push(task);
}

function getTask() {
	return todoList.shift();
}

function rememberUrgently(task) {
	todoList.unshift(task);
}
```

- This program manages a queue of tasks
	- You add tasks to the end of the queue by calling `remember("groceries")`
	- When you're ready to do something, you call `getTask()` to get (and remove) the front item from the queue
	- The `rememberUrgently` function also adds a task but adds it to the front instead of the back of the queue
- To search for a specific value, arrays provide an `indexOf` method
- The method searches through the array from the start to the end and returns the index at which the requested value was found - or `-1` if it wasn't found
- To search from the end instead of the start, there's a similar method called `lastIndexOf`
- Both `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` take an optional second argument that indicates where to start searching

```
console.log([1, 2, 3, 2].indexOf(2)); // 1
console.log([1, 2, 3, 2].lastIndexOf(2)); // 3
```

- Another fundamental array method is `slice`, which takes start and end indices and returns an array that has only the elements between them
- The start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive
- When the end index is not given, `slice` will take all of the elements after the start index
- You can also omit the start index to copy the entire array

```
console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2, 4)); // [2, 3]
console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2)); // [2, 3, 4]
```

- The `concat` method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array, similar to what the `+` operator does for strings
- If you pass `concat` an argument that is not an array, that value will be added to the new array as if it were a one-element array

**Strings and their properties**

- We can read properties like `length` and `toUpperCase` from string values, but if you try to add a new property, it doesn't stick

```
let person = "John Doe";
person.age = 88;
console.log(person.age); // undefined
```

- Values of type string, number and boolean are not objects, and though the language doesn't complain if you try to set new properties on them, it doesn't actually store those properties
- Such values are immutable and cannot be changed, but they do have built-in properties
- Every string value has a number of methods - some very useful ones are `slice` and `indexOf`, which resemble the array methods of the same name

```
console.log("coconuts".slice(4, 7)); // nut
console.log("coconuts".indexOf("nut")); // 4
```

- The `trim` method removes whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs and similar characters) from the start and end of a string

```
console.log("  Okay   \n".trim()); // Okay
```

- The `zeroPad` function from the previous chapter also exists as a method - it is called `padStart` and takes the desired length and padding character as arguments

```
console.log(String(6).padStart(3, "0")); // 006
```

- You can split a string on every occurrence of another string with `split` and join it again with `join`

```
let sentence = "Welcome to the Universe of Hypertext";

let words = sentence.split(" ");
console.log(words); // ["Welcome", "to", "the", "Universe", "of", "Hypertext"]

console.log(words.join(" ")); // Welcome to the Universe of Hypertext
```

- A string can be repeated with the `repeat` method

```
console.log("LA".repeat(3)); // LALALA
```

**Rest parameters**

- It can be useful for a function to accept any number of arguments
- For example, `Math.max` computes the maximum of *all* the arguments it is given
- To write such a function, you put three dots before the function's last parameter

```
function max(...numbers) {
	let result = -Infinity;
	for (let number of numbers) {
		if (number > result) {
			result = number;
		}
	}
	return result;
}

console.log(max(4, 1, 2, 9, -2)); // 9
```

- When such a function is called, the *rest parameter* is bound to an array containing all further arguments
- If there are other parameters before it, their values aren't part of that array
- When, as in `max`, it is the only parameter, it will hold all arguments
- You can use a similar three-dot notation to *call* a function with an array of arguments

```
function max(...numbers) {
	let result = -Infinity;
	for (let number of numbers) {
		if (number > result) {
			result = number;
		}
	}
	return result;
}

let numbers = [4, 1, 2, 9, -2];
console.log(max(...numbers)); // 9
```

- Square bracket array notation similarly allows the triple-dot operator to spread another array into the new array

```
let arr = [2, 3];
console.log([1, ...arr, 4]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**The Math object**

- `Math` is a grab bag of number-related utility functions, such as `Math.max` (maximum), `Math.min` (minimum) and `Math.sqrt` (square root)
- The `Math` object is used as a container to group a bunch of related functionality
- There is only one `Math` object and it is almost never useful as a value
- Rather, it provides a *namespace* so that all these functions and values do not have to be global bindings
- Having too many global bindings "pollutes" the namespace - the more names have been taken, the more likely you are to accidentally overwrite the value of some existing binding
- For example, it's not unlikely to want to name something `max` in one of your programs
- Since JS's built-in `max` function is tucked safely inside the `Math` object, we don't have to worry about overwriting it
- Many languages will stop you, or at least warn you, when you are defining a binding with a name that is already taken
- JS does this for bindings you declared with `let` or `const` - but not for standard bindings nor for bindings declared with `var` or `function`
- Back to the `Math` object - the number π (pi) - or at least the closest approximation that fits in a JS number - is available as `Math.PI`
- If you need to do trigonometry, `Math` can help - it contains `sin` (sine), `cos` (cosine) and `tan` (tangent), as well as their inverse functions, `acos`, `asin` and `atan`, respectively
- `Math.random` is a function that returns a new pseudorandom number between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive) every time you call it
- If we want a whole random number instead of a fractional one, we can use `Math.floor` (which rounds down to the nearest whole number) or `Math.ceil` (which rounds up to the nearest whole number) on the result of `Math.random`

```
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)); // Pseudorandom number greater than or equal to 0 and below 10
```

**Destructuring**

- If you know the value and your binding is an array, you can use square brackets to "look inside" of the value, binding its contents
- This works for bindings created with `let`, `const`, `var` and function arguments

```
let [x, y, z] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(x); // 1
console.log(y); // 2
console.log(z); // 3

function sayHello([firstName, lastName]) {
	console.log(`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
}
sayHello(["John", "Doe"]); // Hello John Doe!
```

- A similar trick works for objects, using braces instead of square brackets

```
let { firstName, lastName } = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };

console.log(firstName); // John
console.log(lastName); // Doe
```

**JSON**

- Because properties only grasp their value, rather than contain it, objects and arrays are stored in the computer's memory as sequences of bits holding the *addresses* - the place in memory - of their contents
- If you want to save data in a file for later or send it to another computer over the network, you have to somehow convert these tangles of memory addresses to a description that can be stored or sent
- What we can do is *serialize* the data - that means it is converted into a flat description
- A popular serialization format is called *JSON*, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- It is widely used as a data storage and communication format on the Web, even in languages other than JS
- JSON looks similar to JS's way of writing arrays and objects, with a few restrictions
- All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes and only simple data expressions are allowed - no function calls, bindings, or anything that involves actual computation
- Comments are not allowed in JSON
- JS gives us the functions `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to convert data to and from this format
- `JSON.stringify` takes a JS value and returns a JSON-encoded string
- `JSON.parse` takes such a string and converts it to the value it encodes
